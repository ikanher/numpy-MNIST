# Tira project report - Week 6

## What did I do?
* Finished peer review 2
* Added support for linear regression with Mean Squared Error -loss function
* Added example scripts for doing linear regression.
* Left for a holiday, yay!

## How has the program progressed?
The program is quite ready now.

## What did I learn?
* More about linear regression with MSE

## What problems did I have?
* MSE loss function unit checking was not trivial at all. I still probably have a small bug somewhere, as the numerically calculated gradient seems to be exactly ten times as large as the analytical gradient.

## What next?
* Hopefully not much. I have only one or two days to do finishing touches if I have missed something relevant.

## Hours
* Only around 12 hours this week
