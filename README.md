# numpy-MNIST

This repository is for Laboratory work for the course **Data structures and algorithms** at **University of Helsinki**.

Simple neural network library `Taivasnet` that comes with examples of how to train and predict MNIST data.

There's also included an example toy model for using the library for simple linear regression.
