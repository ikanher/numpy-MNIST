# numpy-MNIST

This repository is for Laboratory work for the course **Data structures and algorithms** at **University of Helsinki**.

Simple neural network library **Taivasnet** that comes with an example of how to train and predict [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) data.

Project does not use any external deep learning libraries and it depends only on [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) (and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for displaying the images).

There's also included an example toy model for using the library for simple linear regression.
